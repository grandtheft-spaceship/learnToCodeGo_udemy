### Why choose the Programming Language?

* Created by:
  * Ken Thompson (B, C, Unix, UTF-8)
  * Rob Pike (Unix, UTF-8)
  * Robert Griesemer (Hotspot, JVM)

* [What is the purpose of the Go programming language?](https://golang.org/doc/faq#What_is_the_purpose_of_the_project)
* [Go at Google: Language Design in the Service of Software Engineering](https://talks.golang.org/2012/splash.article)

* Go is:
  * performant
  * works *well* with multiple cores
  * able to run *concurreny*
  * a *compiled language*
    * This means it translates directly to *binary*; there are no *virtual machines*, no *interpretting*
    * Designed to run really well in a *network environment*
  * has garbage collection
    * Able to manage memory for the user
  * has clean syntax
  * has a powerful standard library

* Go is a systems-level, low-level language with a powerful standard library that allows high-level functionality
